# Known Bugs

## Displays

- Sometime, the resolution of the display is not correctly set, leading to a stretched image.

## Controls

### Editor

- The language highlighter in the script editor does not always correctly highlight the code, especially when first opened.

### Canvas Scripting

- The canvas scripting are missing some type declarations, which leads to errors in the editor (but not in the execution).

### Layers Visibility

- In some case, when switching a layer visibility and then, afterwards, making changes in the script editor, the layer visibility switches back to the previous state.
