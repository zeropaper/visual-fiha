# Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains the documentation for the Visual Fiha project, including architecture overviews, project structure, and detailed explanations of components and features.

The files at the root of this directory provide a high-level overview of the system's architecture and its components, such as scriptables, controls, inputs, layers, and the main worker.
Except the README.md (this file), the documents at the root are also **passed as context to the AI assistant** for generating code snippets and explanations.

The sub-directories contain more detailed documentation on specific topics, such as messaging architecture, project structure, and the various features of the controls application.
These documents are **not passed as context to the AI assistant** but are available for developers and reference.
